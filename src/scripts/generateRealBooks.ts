## Chapter 1: An Exposition of Romans 8:13

"For if you live after the flesh, you shall die: but if you through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, you shall live." - Romans 8:13

### 1. Foundation in Romans 8:13

To make my guidance on overcoming sin in believers organized and clear, I'll base it on the Apostle's words: "If you, through the Spirit, put to death the deeds of the body, you will live" (Rom 8:13). I'll concentrate on the profound evangelical truth and mystery found in these words.

After reiterating the doctrine of justification by faith and the blessed state of those who experience it through grace (vv. 1-3), the Apostle goes on to encourage holiness and comfort for believers.

Among his arguments and motivations for holiness, the verse mentioned offers one by contrasting the outcomes of holiness and sin: "If you live according to the flesh, you will die." I won't delve into the meanings of "living after the flesh" and "to die" beyond how they relate to the latter part of the verse, since that's not my current focus.

In the words specifically intended as the foundation for the upcoming discussion, we find:

First, a duty prescribed: "Put to death the deeds of the body."

Second, the individuals to whom the duty is prescribed: "You" - "if you put to death."

Third, a promise attached to the duty: "You will live."

Fourth, the means or cause of performing the duty is the Spirit: "If you, through the Spirit."

Fifth, the condition of the whole proposition, which includes duty, means, and promise: "If you, through the Spirit, put to death the deeds of the body, you will live."

### 2. Connection between True Overcoming Sin and Salvation

The first thing we notice in the words, as they appear in the entire proposition, is the conditional note: "but if." Conditionals in such propositions can signify one of two things:

a. The uncertainty of the outcome or the thing promised concerning those to whom the duty is prescribed. This happens when the condition is absolutely necessary to bring about the result and doesn't depend on any specific cause known to the person it's prescribed to. We might say, "If we live, we will do such a thing." This can't be the intent of the conditional expression here. For the people these words are spoken to, it is said, "There is no condemnation for them" (Rom 8:1).

b. The certainty of the connection between the things mentioned, as when we say to a sick person, "If you take this medicine or use this remedy, you will get better." The only thing we intend to express is the certainty of the connection between the medicine or remedy and health. That's how it's used here. The certain connection between overcoming the deeds of the body and living is hinted at in this conditional particle.

Since the possible connections between things can be numerous, such as cause and effect or means and end, this connection between overcoming sin and life isn't precisely cause and effect, for "the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ" (Rom 6:23). The connection is more of means and end. God has appointed this means for achieving the end He has freely promised. Means, though necessary, have a proper subordination to a result that's freely promised. A gift and something in the recipient that causes them to receive it are incompatible. The intention, then, of this conditional proposition is that there's a certain infallible connection between true overcoming sin and eternal life: if you use this means, you will achieve that result; if you overcome sin, you will live. The main motivation for and enforcement of the duty of overcoming sin lies in this.

## Chapter 2: Continuous Activity of Indwelling Sin

### 1. The First Principle for Mortification: It Must Be Continuous

Having laid this foundation, let's briefly confirm the previously mentioned principal deductions, which will lead me to the main point:

Principle I: The most devout believers, who are certainly free from the condemning power of sin, should still make it their priority all their days to mortify the indwelling power of sin.

The apostle says, "Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth" (Col 3:5). To whom is he speaking? Those who were "risen with Christ" (3:1); those who were "dead" with Him (v. 3); those who have Christ as their "life," and shall "appear with him in glory" (v. 4). Mortify! Make it your daily work. Be always at it while you live; never take a day off from this work. Be killing sin, or it will be killing you! Your being dead with Christ by identification and your being revived with Him won't excuse you from this work (Rom 6:3-4).

Our Savior tells us how His Father deals with every branch in Him that bears fruit, every true and living branch: "He purges it, that it may bring forth more fruit" (John 15:2). He prunes it, and that not for a day or two, but all the while it's a branch in this world. And the apostle tells you what was his practice: "I discipline my body and bring it into subjection" (1 Cor 9:27). "I do it," he says, "daily. It's the work of my life. I never skip it. This is my business." And if this was the work and business of Paul—who was so incredibly exalted in grace, revelations, enjoyments, privileges, and consolations, far beyond the average believer—how can we possibly defend an exemption from this work and duty while we're in this world? Mortification must continue throughout the believer's life on earth.

### 2. Reasons Mortification Must Be Continuous

Indwelling sin always remains while we're in this world; therefore, it always needs to be mortified. I'm not going to get into the pointless, foolish, and ignorant disputes of people about perfectly obeying God's commands, about perfection in this life, or about being completely and utterly dead to sin. It's more than likely that those who advocate these false ideas never knew what it means to obey any of God's commands, and are so far from perfection that they've never attained even sincere obedience in all aspects of their lives.

Many people these days talk about perfection, and they often say that it means not knowing the difference between good and evil. They're not claiming to be perfect in what we consider good, but rather that everything is the same to them. To them, the pinnacle of wickedness is their idea of perfection.

Knowing that it's our duty to overcome sin while it still exists within us, we must take action. If someone is assigned to defeat an enemy, stopping their attack before the enemy is defeated means they've only done half the job (Gal 6:9; Heb 12:1; 2 Cor 7:1).

Sin not only remains within us, but it's also constantly acting, striving to produce deeds of the flesh. We could leave sin alone if it ever left us alone, but sin is never more active than when it appears to be quiet. Its influence is often strongest when it's not obvious, so our efforts against sin should be vigorous at all times and in every situation, even when we least suspect its presence.

## Chapter 3: The Spirit as the Only Effectual Agent

### 1. The Spirit's Role in Mortification

It must be done by the Spirit. Men may attempt this work based on other principles, with means and helps appointed for other reasons, as they have always done and still do. But the apostle says this is the work of the Spirit; it is to be accomplished by Him alone and by no other power.

Mortification carried out by our own strength, worked out by self-invented ways and aims at self-righteousness, is the heart and substance of all false religion in the world. This leads me to lay down some principles that must be established to direct us in our understanding of how the Spirit mortifies sin.

### 2. What Mortification Is Not

a. Mortification is not the utter destruction of a sin. Sin will dwell in us as long as we live in this world. Though it may be suppressed so that it can't break out into scandalous acts for some time, yet it is not killed or destroyed.

b. Mortification is not the dissipation of a lust by diverting the course of the soul to another object. When a man changes one lust for another - trading pride for sensuality, or sensuality for covetousness, or covetousness for ambition - this is not mortifying but changing one sin for another.

c. Mortification is not the improvement of our natural temper. Some men, through their natural temperament, may be less inclined to certain sins than others, but this is not true mortification.

### 3. What True Mortification Is

True mortification is the habitual weakening of lust and constantly opposing its actings and efforts, so as to prevent them from breaking forth into life. The weakening of its power, energy, and working is the substance of this duty.

When sin is mortified in a person, it is like a man who has received a mortal wound; he may struggle and move, as a man wounded to death may do, but these are the strugglings and motions of a dying man. So, when lust or any particular sin is truly mortified, though it may sometimes struggle and act, these are only the struggles of a dying person.

The life, power, vigor, and comfort of our spiritual lives depend on the mortification of the deeds of the flesh.

## Chapter 1: The Reed and the Bruising

The prophet Isaiah, being lifted up and carried with the wing of a prophetical spirit, passes over all the time between him and the appearing of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Seeing with the eye of prophecy, and with the eye of faith, Christ as present, he presents him, in the name of God, to the spiritual eye of others, in these words: 'Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard in the street. A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth' (Isa. 42:1-3).

These words are alleged by Matthew as fulfilled now in Christ (Matt. 12:18-20). In them are propounded, first, the calling of Christ to his office; secondly, the manner in which he carries it out.

God calls him here his servant. Christ was God's servant in the greatest piece of service that ever was, a chosen and a choice servant who did and suffered all by commission from the Father. In this we may see the sweet love of God to us, in that he counts the work of our salvation by Christ his greatest service, and in that he will put his only beloved Son to that service.

What a support to our faith is this, that God the Father, the party offended by our sins, is so well pleased with the work of redemption! And what a comfort is this, that, seeing God's love rests on Christ, as well pleased in him, we may gather that he is as well pleased with us, if we be in Christ! For his love rests in a whole Christ, in Christ mystical, as well as Christ natural, because he loves him and us with one love.

### What It Is to Be Bruised

The bruised reed is a man that for the most part is in some misery, as those were that came to Christ for help, and by misery he is brought to see sin as the cause of it, for, whatever pretences sin makes, they come to an end when we are bruised and broken. He is sensible of sin and misery, even unto bruising; and, seeing no help in himself, is carried with restless desire to have supply from another, with some hope, which a little raises him out of himself to Christ, though he dare not claim any present interest of mercy.

This spark of hope being opposed by doubtings and fears rising from corruption makes him as smoking flax; so that both these together, a bruised reed and smoking flax, make up the state of a poor distressed man. This is such an one as our Saviour Christ terms 'poor in spirit' (Matt. 5:3), who sees his wants, and also sees himself indebted to divine justice.

### The Good Effects of Bruising

This bruising is required before conversion that so the Spirit may make way for himself into the heart by levelling all proud, high thoughts, and that we may understand ourselves to be what indeed we are by nature. We love to wander from ourselves and to be strangers at home, till God bruises us by one cross or other, and then we 'begin to think', and come home to ourselves with the prodigal (Luke 15:17).

Again, this bruising makes us set a high price upon Christ. Then the gospel becomes the gospel indeed; then the fig leaves of morality will do us no good. And it makes us more thankful, and, from thankfulness, more fruitful in our lives; for what makes many so cold and barren, but that bruising for sin never endeared God's grace to them?

## Chapter 2: Christ Will Not Break the Bruised Reed

We see, therefore, that the condition of those with whom he was to deal was that they were bruised reeds and smoking flax; not trees, but reeds; and not whole, but bruised reeds. The church is compared to weak things: to a dove amongst the fowls; to a vine amongst the plants; to sheep amongst the beasts; to a woman, which is the weaker vessel.

God's children are bruised reeds before their conversion and oftentimes after. Before conversion all (except such as, being brought up in the church, God has delighted to show himself gracious to from their childhood) are bruised reeds, yet in different degrees, as God sees fit.

Christ's manner of dealing with such souls is full of gentleness. He knows our mould, that we are but dust. He will not break that which is bruised already, nor quench that small measure of grace which sends up weak desires to heaven like smoky breath.

This gives great encouragement to weak Christians. Though grace be small, it is true grace if it comes from Christ. A small spark is fire as well as a great flame.

### For Ourselves

We should, therefore, neither despair in ourselves nor despise others. If God's Spirit has but begun a good work in us, let us not stifle it, but encourage it. Christ takes notice of the least beginnings of grace.

### Who Are the Bruised Reeds?

Those that are brought to feel their sins and miseries, that are poor in spirit, that mourn for sin, that thirst after righteousness. These bruised ones are sensible of their burden. They see their sin and misery; they feel the weight of God's displeasure; they apprehend the curse of the law; they are pressed down under the sense of God's wrath. Yet withal they have some little hope, some breathing after God and goodness.

Though they are bruised, they are not broken. Though they are bowed down, they are not utterly cast down. There is some sap of spiritual life in them, some moving toward God, some desire after grace and mercy. This is the smoking flax - weak, but not quite extinguished.

Christ will cherish the least measure of grace and the weakest degree of goodness. He will not despise the day of small things.

## Chapter 1: A Preliminary Discourse To Catechising

'If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled.' - Col 1:23.

Intending next Lord's day to enter upon the work of catechising, it will not be amiss to give you a preliminary discourse, to show you how needful it is for Christians to be well instructed in the grounds of religion. 'If ye continue in the faith grounded and settled.'

I. It is the duty of Christians to be settled in the doctrine of faith.

II. The best way for Christians to be settled is to be well grounded.

### The Duty of Christians to be Settled

To be settled is to be confirmed and established. A settled Christian is one who is orthodox and steadfast in religion. By nature we are unsettled. We are as chaff which the wind drives away. The apostle speaks of some who are 'carried about with every wind of doctrine' (Eph 4:14). How needful is it to drop anchor and be settled!

Three things cause unsettledness in religion:

1. Error. Error unsettles the mind. A man in an error is like a man in a mist; he knows not which way to go. Error makes the soul fluctuate and waver.

2. Doubtfulness. When men have not a settled judgment in the things of God, but are in doubt and suspense about them, this makes them unsteady. 

3. Weakness. When men are weak in knowledge and faith, though they are right, yet they are unfixed. A young plant, though it grows in good soil, yet every wind shakes it because it has not taken deep root.

### The Necessity of Being Grounded

The best way for Christians to be settled is to be well grounded in the fundamental principles of religion. To be grounded is to have the foundation truths of religion fixed in the mind and rooted in the heart.

There are some fundamental points in religion which we must know; as, what God is, what Christ is, how we must be saved, what faith is, what repentance is. These are foundation principles, and we must be well grounded in them.

## Chapter 2: Man's Chief End

What is the chief end of man? Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him for ever.

The chief end of man is to glorify God. This is the diamond in the ring, the principal thing aimed at. God made us for his own praise. 'This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.' We are called God's glory.

To glorify God is to think and speak highly of him, and to act for his honor. God's glory is the result of his perfections. As the sun's brightness is the result of its nature, so God's glory is the brightness and luster of his attributes shining forth.

We glorify God actively when we make it our design to honor him; passively, when we are made instances of his mercy or justice. The vessels of mercy glorify God by being saved; the vessels of wrath glorify him by being damned.

This chief end teaches us that we must not live to ourselves. Self is too narrow a bottom for a man to build his happiness upon. We must live to higher and nobler purposes - to honor God who gave us our being.

### How We Glorify God

We glorify God by our prayers. Prayer honors God because it acknowledges our dependence upon him and gives him the honor due to his name.

We glorify God by believing his promises. Faith gives God the glory of his truth. When we believe God's word, we set our seal to it that God is true.

We glorify God by holy obedience. When we keep his commandments, we honor him. A holy life is a mirror in which the glory of God is reflected.

We glorify God by patience under afflictions. When we suffer for righteousness' sake and bear our crosses patiently, we honor God and show the world that we value his favor more than all worldly comforts.

## Chapter 3: How We May Know God

What rule hath God given to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him? The Word of God, which is contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, is the only rule to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him.

The Scripture is our compass by which we steer to glory. The Scripture is both our directory and diary: it shows us the way we should walk, and it reports how others have walked in this way before us.

The Scripture is like the pool of Bethesda: there is a healing virtue in it for all spiritual diseases. It is called 'the sword of the Spirit,' because the Spirit of God wields and manages it. When Satan tempted Christ, our Savior drew this sword: 'It is written.'

### The Authority of Scripture

The Scripture has authority from God. It is God-breathed. The penmen of Scripture wrote as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. They were not merely secretaries to take down what was dictated, but instruments that the Spirit of God used.

The Scripture is a complete rule. It is perfect, containing everything needed for salvation and godliness. We are not to add to it or take from it.

The Scripture is a pure rule. There is no error in it. Though the penmen were fallible men, yet in their writing of Scripture they were kept from error by the Spirit of God.

### The Usefulness of Scripture

The Scripture is useful for doctrine. It teaches us what we are to believe concerning God and what duty God requires of us.

The Scripture is useful for reproof. It convinces us of sin and error. It is like a mirror that shows us our spots.

The Scripture is useful for correction. It not only shows us our faults but helps to amend them. It is like a medicine that both discovers the disease and cures it.

The Scripture is useful for instruction in righteousness. It guides us in the paths of holiness and teaches us how to live to God's glory.

        title: "Man's Chief End",
        content: "What is the chief end of man? Man's chief end is to glorify God, and to enjoy him for ever.\n\nThe chief end of man is to glorify God. This is the diamond in the ring, the principal thing aimed at. God made us for his own praise. 'This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my praise.' We are called God's glory.\n\nTo glorify God is to think and speak highly of him, and to act for his honor. God's glory is the result of his perfections. As the sun's brightness is the result of its nature, so God's glory is the brightness and luster of his attributes shining forth.\n\nWe glorify God actively when we make it our design to honor him; passively, when we are made instances of his mercy or justice. The vessels of mercy glorify God by being saved; the vessels of wrath glorify him by being damned.\n\nThis chief end teaches us that we must not live to ourselves. Self is too narrow a bottom for a man to build his happiness upon. We must live to higher and nobler purposes - to honor God who gave us our being.\n\nWe glorify God by our prayers. Prayer honors God because it acknowledges our dependence upon him and gives him the honor due to his name. We glorify God by believing his promises. Faith gives God the glory of his truth. We glorify God by holy obedience. When we keep his commandments, we honor him."

        title: "How We May Know God",
        content: "What rule hath God given to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him? The Word of God, which is contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, is the only rule to direct us how we may glorify and enjoy him.\n\nThe Scripture is our compass by which we steer to glory. The Scripture is both our directory and diary: it shows us the way we should walk, and it reports how others have walked in this way before us.\n\nThe Scripture is like the pool of Bethesda: there is a healing virtue in it for all spiritual diseases. It is called 'the sword of the Spirit,' because the Spirit of God wields and manages it. When Satan tempted Christ, our Savior drew this sword: 'It is written.'\n\nThe Scripture has authority from God. It is God-breathed. The penmen of Scripture wrote as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. They were not merely secretaries to take down what was dictated, but instruments that the Spirit of God used.\n\nThe Scripture is a complete rule. It is perfect, containing everything needed for salvation and godliness. We are not to add to it or take from it. The Scripture is useful for doctrine. It teaches us what we are to believe concerning God and what duty God requires of us. The Scripture is useful for reproof. It convinces us of sin and error. The Scripture is useful for correction. It not only shows us our faults but helps to amend them. The Scripture is useful for instruction in righteousness. It guides us in the paths of holiness and teaches us how to live to God's glory."
